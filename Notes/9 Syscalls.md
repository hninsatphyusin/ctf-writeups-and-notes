# Syscall Calling Convention 
To call a syscall, we have to:
1. Save registers to stack
2. Set its syscall number inÂ `rax`
3. Set its arguments in the registers
4. Use the syscall assembly instruction to call it

|Description|64-bit Register|8-bit Register|
|---|---|---|
|Syscall Number/Return value|`rax`|`al`|
|Callee Saved|`rbx`|`bl`|
|1st arg|`rdi`|`dil`|
|2nd arg|`rsi`|`sil`|
|3rd arg|`rdx`|`dl`|
|4th arg|`rcx`|`cl`|
|5th arg|`r8`|`r8b`|
|6th arg|`r9`|`r9b`|
